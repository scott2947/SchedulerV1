# Scheduler
A simple, text-based time management application written in Python.
<h3>Project limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tasks must be internal to a day, due to time as opposed to date and time being used to track tasks</li>
<li>Task names must be unique (they are identifiers)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ruleset:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always block at the end of major functions</li>
<li>Always reset highlighting at the end of functions, or before called functions</li>
<li>When making a choice, avoid extra space between the options and the entry</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reminders</h3>
<ul>
<li>Insert all function calls in container functions</li>
<li>Write all functions dependent on not yet present infrastructure</li>
<li>Tidy up final product</li>
</ul>
